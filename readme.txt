This plugin gives you instant access to your blog’s essential traffic and rankings data from Google Analytics 4 and Search Console, inside WordPress.

== Description ==

The "Blog essential traffic and rankings from Google" plugin gives you instant access to your essential traffic and rankings data pulled from your Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and Google Search Console (GSC), without leaving WordPress and digging into the complex (and slow) GA4 and GSC data views.

It sorts through oceans of data in GA4 and GSC and extracts only the stats you really need as a blogger such as:

- View your site’s pageviews, sessions, organic traffic, time on page, average ranking
- See traffic evolution over time
- View traffic and rankings by post for a given time frame (30 days, 1 week, etc)
- Track changes in traffic and rankings by post
- See your traffic sources including organic sources, social, referrals
- Find your top search queries sitewide and for each post!
- View traffic by top countries

Easily connect your WordPress site to your GA4 and GSC accounts just once, then access your stats with a simple click inside WP. 

The data is shared directly with your WordPress site (not with some developer) so no-one else but you has access to it.

The free version of the plugin gives you access to a dashboard containing all the key information listed above, in the form of graphs and “top 10” tables. You also have access to the full list of search queries for your website as well as for each post. The premium version lets you dig deeper beyond the top 10 for several metrics.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who is this plugin for? =

It is for bloggers who need to access their crucial site performance data more easily than through using the convoluted GA4 and GSC web interfaces. 

While GA4 and GSC has all the information a blogger needs including pageviews, sessions, users, rankings, clicks, impressions, CTR, and much more, you typically need to navigate to multiple pages and apply multiple filters on two separate websites (GA4 and GSC) to find all this information.

This plugin simply does that work for you by fetching your GA4 and GSC data in a secure way and pulling the key metrics you really need on a day to day basis. 

Of course, you can always go to your GA4 and/or GSC when you need to dig even deeper into the data - but bloggers rarely do so.
